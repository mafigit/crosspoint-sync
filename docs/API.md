# crosspoint-sync API

The contract for firmware (CrossPoint / CrossInk) and any other client. Two API surfaces share one
account system and the same auth headers:

1. **KOSync-compatible API** at the root — byte-compatible with `sync.koreader.rocks`. Stock
   KOReader and current CrossPoint firmware work by changing only the server URL.
2. **Extended API** under `/api/v1` — lossless CrossPoint positions, bookmarks, clippings,
   reading stats, and document metadata.

All requests and responses are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`). The
`Accept: application/vnd.koreader.v1+json` header is accepted but never required.

## Authentication

Every endpoint except `POST /users/create` and `GET /healthz` requires:

```
x-auth-user: <username>
x-auth-key:  <MD5 hex of the account password>
```

The key is the lowercase 32-hex MD5 of the plain password — exactly what KOReader and CrossPoint
already send. The server never sees the plain password and stores only a salted PBKDF2 of the key.

### Error responses

Errors reuse the stock kosync codes so existing client error handling keeps working:

| HTTP | code | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 401  | 2001 | Missing/invalid auth headers |
| 402  | 2002 | Username already registered |
| 403  | 2003 | Invalid request body / registration disabled |
| 403  | 2004 | Missing or malformed `document` |
| 429  | 2001 | Rate limited (registration / repeated auth failures) |

Body shape is always `{"code": 2001, "message": "Unauthorized"}`.

## Document identity

`document` is an opaque key chosen by the client, up to 64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. CrossPoint
sends the KOReader 32-hex MD5 (partial-binary or filename method, per device setting). The server
never tries to unify the two hash methods; a book synced under both appears as two documents.

## KOSync-compatible API

### POST /users/create

Open registration (disable with `REGISTRATION_DISABLED=true`).

```json
// request
{"username": "justin", "password": "0f359740bd1cda994f8b55330c86d845"}
// 201 response
{"username": "justin"}
```

Usernames: 1–64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9._@+-]`. The `password` field is the MD5 auth key.

### GET /users/auth

Validates credentials. `200 {"authorized": "OK"}` or `401`.

### PUT /syncs/progress

```json
// request
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "crossink-device"
}
// 200 response
{"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "timestamp": 1752345678}
```

- One row is stored per `(user, document, device_id)` — unlike stock kosync, devices never
  overwrite each other. If `device_id` is absent, `device` is used as the device key.
- `percentage` is a float in `[0, 1]`. `timestamp` is unix **seconds** (integer).
- **Superset capture:** the body may include the extended `position` object (see
  `PUT /api/v1/progress`) and/or a `metadata` object (below). If present and valid they are
  stored; unknown fields are ignored. This lets firmware ship rich sync against this endpoint
  with a one-line change.
- **Metadata capture** (KOReader PR #15306 shape, sent by CrossPoint when the "send metadata"
  setting is on):

  ```json
  "metadata": {
    "filename": "Foundryside - Robert Jackson Bennett.epub",
    "title": "Foundryside",
    "authors": "Robert Jackson Bennett",
    "bookfusion_id": "36835"
  }
  ```

  All fields optional strings (≤512 chars). `filename`/`title`/`authors` are stored per
  `(user, document)`; fields the client omits never overwrite previously stored values. Retrieve
  via `GET /api/v1/documents` or joined into `GET /api/v1/progress`.

  **Service ids.** Any extra `<service>_id` field (from a CrossPoint plugin's book sidecar,
  e.g. `bookfusion_id`) pre-seeds an exact match for the connector of that name: progress is
  pushed straight to that record, skipping title/author search. Unknown-connector ids are
  ignored; a user's manual match is never overridden.

  **BookFusion positions.** For a BookFusion download identified by its sidecar, the server
  retrieves the EPUB and resolves the existing KOSync XPath against its chapter XHTML.
  It sends the resulting CFI, chapter index, and text-based spine-normalized position to
  BookFusion. This requires no additional firmware fields. Precision follows the supplied
  XPath: a text-node offset identifies that text position; a paragraph/chapter-only XPath
  identifies its start. An unresolved XPath fails without posting an estimated position.

  When a device requests `GET /syncs/progress/:document` or
  `GET /api/v1/progress/:document`, the server first fetches the matched BookFusion
  book's latest position, resolves its point CFI in the EPUB, and then reads the stored
  progress for the response. This requires a linked, enabled account and a previously
  received sidecar match; a GET cannot discover metadata that the device has not sent.
  BookFusion is not polled in the background. Concurrent requests for the same user's
  book share a lookup; subsequent requests check the provider again.

  Refreshes have a 10-second total deadline. A timeout returns HTTP 504; provider or
  conversion failures return HTTP 502. Stored progress is preserved and the next GET
  retries the refresh. Books without an enabled sidecar match use the normal KOSync
  response. No firmware update is needed. Conversion uses the provider's update
  timestamp, skips older positions, and preserves text offsets (converting UTF-16 CFI
  offsets to CrossPoint codepoints). Delayed outbound
  events also check the remote timestamp before posting, to avoid replacing newer
  BookFusion progress. The provider does not offer an atomic conditional update, so a
  simultaneous edit between that check and the POST is still possible.

  BookFusion's storage ignores Range requests, so an EPUB is downloaded whole (limited
  to 200 MiB and 30 seconds), and only its text entries (container, package, and XHTML)
  are decompressed; each is limited to 1 MiB. The server then stores a redacted position
  map per linked book in `epub_maps`: chapter text is replaced with same-length filler and
  only `id` attributes are kept, so no readable book text is stored, yet positions resolve
  identically. Later syncs use the map without downloading; a position that fails against
  it triggers one fresh download and rebuild (the book may have changed). Maps are removed
  when the connector is unlinked or the account deleted, and pruned when their book is no
  longer matched or unused for 30 days. Books matched by title or manual selection retain percentage-only
  outbound updates and are excluded from inbound position conversion because those matches do not establish that the reader has the same EPUB edition.

### GET /syncs/progress/{document}

Returns the newest progress **across all of the user's devices** (most recent `timestamp` wins):

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "crossink-device",
  "timestamp": 1752345678
}
```

**Quirk (stock-compatible):** if no progress exists, the response is `200` with `{}` — not 404.
KOReader clients check for field presence, not status codes.

---

## Extended API (/api/v1)

Same auth headers. Designed for the ESP32: responses are small (< 8 KB at default limits), keys are
short, batches are capped.

### Delta-sync protocol (bookmarks & clippings)

- `GET ...?since=<unix>&limit=<n>` returns items with `updated_at > since`, oldest first, including
  **tombstones** (`"deleted": 1`). `limit` defaults to 50, max 100.
- The response carries `until` (persist it as the next `since` cursor) and `more` (repeat with
  `since = until` until `more` is false).
- `PUT` batches set `updated_at` on the **server clock** — the server is the last-write-wins
  authority because device RTCs drift. A delete is `{"id": "...", "deleted": 1}` (no other fields
  needed). Deleted items keep tombstones forever so late-syncing devices converge.
- Merge semantics: set-union of ids, last-write-wins per id.

### Rich progress

#### PUT /api/v1/progress

The kosync body plus a `position` object mapping 1:1 to the firmware's `CompactPosition`:

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "progress": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96",
  "percentage": 0.4867,
  "device": "CrossPoint",
  "device_id": "A1B2C3D4",
  "position": {
    "pctQ": 486700,
    "spine": 7,
    "page": 143,
    "pages": 412,
    "para": 96,
    "li": 0,
    "anchor": "ch08-sec2",
    "xpath": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].96"
  }
}
```

| field  | type | notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| pctQ   | uint | percentage × 1,000,000 (0–1,000,000). Layout-independent; authoritative. |
| spine  | uint16 | spine (chapter) index |
| page / pages | uint16 | page within spine / spine page count — **layout hints**, depend on font settings |
| para   | uint16, optional | synthetic 1-based paragraph index; omit when unavailable (`hasParagraphIndex=false`) |
| li     | uint16, optional | running `<li>` count; omit when unavailable |
| anchor | string ≤ 48 bytes, optional | nearest `<a id>` anchor |
| xpath  | string ≤ 120 bytes, optional | KOReader-style xpath |

Response: `{"document": "...", "timestamp": 1752345678}`.

An invalid `position` is ignored (the kosync fields still sync); a missing `position` on a later
PUT keeps the previously stored one for that device.

#### GET /api/v1/progress

Lists every synced document — newest progress across devices, joined with any stored metadata.
This is how clients/UIs discover documents without knowing hashes. `?limit=` defaults to 100
(max 500), ordered newest-first.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {"document": "25f8abb4f4f5594f02f361726814fea1",
     "title": "Foundryside", "author": "Robert Jackson Bennett",
     "filename": "Foundryside - Robert Jackson Bennett.epub",
     "percentage": 0.2853, "progress": "/body/DocFragment[16]/body/div[1]/p[143]",
     "device_id": "crosspoint-reader", "device": "CrossPoint", "timestamp": 1783913361}
  ]
}
```

`title`/`author`/`filename` are `null` until some client sends metadata for that document.
Items also carry `status`, `cover_url`, `page_count`, and book details from Hardcover's catalog
when the server sets `HARDCOVER_API_KEY`: `hardcover_slug`, `moods`, `genres`, `content_warnings`
(lists), `rating`, `series`, `series_position`, `release_year` (empty lists / `null` until looked
up; lookups run in the background, a few books per list request, one per distinct book across users).

#### GET /api/v1/progress/{document}

All device rows, newest first — the client decides what to apply:

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "devices": [
    {"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossPoint", "percentage": 0.4867,
     "progress": "...", "position": { "pctQ": 486700, "spine": 7, "page": 143, "pages": 412 },
     "timestamp": 1752345678},
    {"device_id": "koreader-boox", "device": "boox", "percentage": 0.41,
     "progress": "...", "position": null, "timestamp": 1752300000}
  ]
}
```

`position` is `null` for rows written by plain kosync clients.

#### DELETE /api/v1/progress/{document}

Removes a synced book completely. Deletes the kosync progress for **every** device plus everything
else stored server-side for that book: position samples, bookmarks, clippings, per-book reading
stats, connector matches and any queued connector events. Document metadata goes too, so the book
disappears from `GET /api/v1/progress` and `GET /api/v1/documents`, and `GET
/syncs/progress/{document}` goes back to returning `{}`.

```json
{"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "deleted": true, "rows": 14}
```

`rows` is the number of database rows removed. Returns `404 {"code": 2003, "message": "Unknown
document"}` when the user has no data for that document.

Bookmarks and clippings are hard-deleted rather than tombstoned — there is no book left to
delta-sync against. A device that still holds the file simply re-uploads its state on the next
sync, so this is a server-side reset, not a device-side delete.

### Bookmarks

Item ids are **client-derived**: `id = first 16 hex chars of SHA-256(xpath)`. Deterministic, so
re-adding the same bookmark is idempotent and delete-by-id needs no new device-side state. All
CrossPoint devices must compute ids identically.

#### GET /api/v1/bookmarks/{document}?since=&limit=

```json
{
  "document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90",
  "until": 1752345678,
  "more": false,
  "items": [
    {"id": "9f86d081884c7d65",
     "xpath": "/body/DocFragment[3]/body/p[12]/text().0",
     "percentage": 0.35,
     "summary": "It was the best of times, it was the worst of",
     "si": 3, "pc": 120, "pp": 42,
     "deleted": 0, "updated_at": 1752340000}
  ]
}
```

`si`/`pc`/`pp` are CrossPoint's spine index / chapter page count / page-in-chapter hints
(nullable — layout dependent).

#### PUT /api/v1/bookmarks/{document}

Batch upsert, max 50 items:

```json
{"items": [
  {"id": "9f86d081884c7d65", "xpath": "...", "percentage": 0.35,
   "summary": "...", "si": 3, "pc": 120, "pp": 42},
  {"id": "deadbeef00112233", "deleted": 1}
]}
```

Response: `{"until": 1752345679, "accepted": 2}`.

### Clippings

Mirrors CrossInk's `Clipping` struct (`src/ClippingStore.h`) 1:1. Item ids are client-derived:
`id = first 16 hex chars of SHA-256(created_at_decimal + text)` — both fields are immutable after
creation.

Item shape:

```json
{
  "id": "c0ffee0011223344",
  "spine": 7,
  "start_page": 12, "end_page": 13, "pages": 40,
  "start_word": 5, "end_word": 22, "words": 30,
  "para": 96,
  "chapter": "Chapter 8",
  "text": "So we beat on, boats against the current...",
  "note": null, "color": null,
  "created_at": 1752300000,
  "deleted": 0, "updated_at": 1752340000
}
```

- `para` optional — omit when the firmware has `paragraphIndex == UINT16_MAX`.
- Page/word fields are layout hints, kept verbatim for CrossInk↔CrossInk restore; `para` + `text`
  are the portable anchors.
- `text` ≤ 4096 UTF-8 bytes, `chapter` ≤ 64 chars, `note` ≤ 4096 bytes.
- `note` and `color` are preserved when omitted from updates.
- No per-book cap server-side; the current firmware stores up to 256 active clippings per book.

Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/clippings/{document}?since=&limit=` and
`PUT /api/v1/clippings/{document}` (batch max 50).

Clipping clients should use `GET ...?cursor=0&limit=1&format=reader`. Responses
advertise `sync_version: 2`, include each item's `revision`, and return a monotonic
`cursor` for the next page. Continue until `more` is false. This avoids losing
items that share a second-resolution timestamp. `format=reader` omits `note` and
`color` to bound firmware response memory. Legacy `since` requests remain supported.

`start_offset` and `end_offset` are optional chapter-visible Unicode-codepoint
positions, `[start, end)`, independent of pagination. Supply both or neither.
`layout_signature` preserves compatibility with older page-local word ranges.
A deleted ID cannot be resurrected by a delayed upload; create a new ID to save
the same quote again. Enable **Sync Clippings** in the firmware's **CrossPoint Sync**
settings to sync clippings alongside the current book's manual progress sync.

#### KOReader anchors (`xpath_start` / `xpath_end`) — fork extension

Clippings may also carry KOReader's exact highlight positions (`pos0` / `pos1` xpointers):

```json
{"id": "...", "spine": 7, "text": "...", "created_at": 1752300000,
 "xpath_start": "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].12",
 "xpath_end":   "/body/DocFragment[8]/body/div[2]/p[4]/text()[1].53"}
```

- Both or neither; each a string starting with `/`, ≤ 512 bytes. Explicit `null`s clear the pair.
- **Omitted = keep stored.** CrossInk firmware never sends these fields, so its updates never erase
  anchors a KOReader client attached. (All other fields still replace the row on PUT — a client
  updating someone else's clipping must echo the positional fields it received.)
- Returned by `GET /api/v1/clippings/{document}` and `GET /api/v1/clippings`; omitted from
  `format=reader` responses to keep firmware memory bounded.
- Clients detect support via `GET /healthz` → `"features": ["clipping_xpath"]`.

### Reading stats

Model (matches the firmware's nearby P2P stats sync): **each device uploads its own snapshot;
snapshots replace, never accumulate; the server aggregates across devices on read.** Never merge
another device's stats into local ones.

#### PUT /api/v1/stats/global

The device's `GlobalReadingStats` as JSON:

```json
{
  "device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossInk",
  "v": 5,
  "sessions": 312, "seconds": 184300, "pages": 9120, "completed": 14,
  "tod": [1200, 84000, 60100, 39000],
  "dow": [8000, 9000, 7000, 11000, 12000, 60000, 77300],
  "anchor_day": 9650,
  "history_b64": "<base64 of the 92-byte reading-history bitmap>",
  "streak": 21
}
```

- `tod` = seconds in [morning, afternoon, evening, night]; `dow` = Mon..Sun seconds.
- `anchor_day` = days since 2000-01-01 of the bitmap's most recent day; bit N of the bitmap =
  `anchor_day - N` (LSB-first within each byte, 730 days / 92 bytes).
- `streak` = device-reported all-time longest streak (may predate the bitmap window).

Response: `{"until": 1752345678}`.

#### PUT /api/v1/stats/books

Batch (max 20) of per-book `stats_v5` snapshots for one device:

```json
{"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "items": [
  {"document": "a1b2c3d4e5f60718293a4b5c6d7e8f90", "v": 5,
   "sessions": 9, "seconds": 8400, "pages": 310, "completed": false,
   "avg_fwd": 12, "pace_n": 250, "eta": 5400,
   "start_manual": false, "finish_manual": false,
   "start_date": 1751000000, "finished_date": 0,
   "tod": [0, 3000, 4000, 1400], "dow": [0, 0, 1200, 0, 2000, 3000, 2200]}
]}
```

#### GET /api/v1/stats/summary

Server-side aggregate across all of the user's devices:

- scalars and `tod`/`dow` are summed;
- history bitmaps are **OR-ed after re-anchoring** to the newest `anchor_day` (each device's bits
  shift by its anchor delta; days older than the 730-day window drop);
- `streak` = max(longest run in the combined bitmap, any device-reported streak);
- `current_streak` = run ending at the anchor day (the anchor day itself may be unset — today
  isn't over).

```json
{
  "sessions": 402, "seconds": 190300, "pages": 9500, "completed": 15,
  "tod": [...], "dow": [...],
  "anchor_day": 9650, "history_b64": "...", "streak": 21, "current_streak": 6,
  "devices": [{"device_id": "A1B2C3D4", "device": "CrossInk", "updated_at": 1752345678}]
}
```

#### GET /api/v1/stats/global

Raw per-device snapshots (`{"devices": [{"device_id", "device", "updated_at", "stats": {...}}]}`)
for clients that render per-device numbers like the P2P screen does.

#### GET /api/v1/stats/books/{document}

Per-device rows plus a `combined` object (scalars/buckets summed, `completed` OR-ed, `avg_fwd`
weighted by `pace_n`, `start_date` = earliest non-zero, `finished_date` = latest).

### Documents metadata (optional)

`PUT /api/v1/documents` — `{"items": [{"document": "...", "title": "...", "author": "...",
"filename": "...", "filesize": 812345}]}` (max 50); omitted fields never overwrite stored values.
`GET /api/v1/documents` lists them. Most clients don't need this endpoint — progress-PUT
`metadata` capture populates the same table.

#### PUT /api/v1/documents/{document}/status

Manual reading status: `{"status": "reading" | "paused" | "finished" | "dnf"}`, or
`{"status": null}` to go back to deriving it from progress. `finished` also fans out a finished
event to linked write-connectors.

With `"status": "finished"` an optional `finished_at` (unix seconds, not in the future) backdates
the finish, e.g. when importing reading history: it becomes `status_at` and the book's finish date
in activity, and connectors that keep read dates use it (Hardcover closes the read on that day;
StoryGraph sets the read's finish date, also on a book already marked read there). Any other
status with `finished_at` is rejected. `GET /api/v1/progress` items carry the effective `status`
(manual, else `finished` at ≥ 98%, else `reading`) and `cover_url`.

#### GET /api/v1/documents/{document}/cover

`{"url": "https://..." | null, "pages": 433 | null}`: cover URL and print-edition page count,
resolved from the document's title/author and cached (a miss is retried after 7 days). Covers come
from iTunes Search (ebooks), then Open Library; page counts from Open Library, then Google Books when
the server has `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`, then Amazon's "Print length" via SearchAPI when it has
`SEARCHAPI_KEY`. `GET /api/v1/progress` items also carry `page_count`.

#### PUT /api/v1/documents/{document}/info

Manual fixes when the lookup got it wrong: `{"cover_url": "https://...", "page_count": 433}` (either
field optional). Manual values stick, since lookups only fill blanks; `null` clears a field so it's
looked up again. Returns the stored `{document, cover_url, page_count}`.

#### GET /api/v1/documents/{document}/cover/candidates?q=

Up to 12 covers to choose from (`{"items": [{url, title, author, source, pages}]}`), best matches
first, from Apple Books and Open Library. `q` searches a different title.

#### GET /api/v1/clippings

Every live clipping across all books, newest first (max 5000): `{"items": [{document, id, spine,
para, start_offset, chapter, text, note, created_at}]}`. Read-only convenience for apps; devices
keep using the per-document delta sync.

#### GET /api/v1/stats/activity?tz=

Pages and books derived from the progress history, for readers that never send stats (stock
CrossPoint, KOReader). Every progress change is logged server-side. `tz` is the client's
`Date#getTimezoneOffset()` so days bucket locally.

```json
{"pages_total": 1923,
 "books": [{"document": "...", "started_at": 1790000000, "last_at": 1790600000, "percentage": 0.997,
            "finished_at": 1790600000, "page_count": 400, "pages_read": 399}],
 "days": [{"day": "2026-09-28", "pages": 56, "syncs": 4,
           "books": [{"document": "...", "pages": 56, "syncs": 4, "from": 0.41, "to": 0.55}]}]}
```

Pages are print pages (furthest percent x page count), not screen pages. A day's `pages` counts only
forward progress after a book's first logged sync, as a running max across devices; `syncs` counts
every logged sync that day, so any day with a sync is a reading day. `books` breaks the day down per
book for a reading timeline; `from`/`to` are the furthest position before and after that day. History from before the log
existed is backfilled from progress samples (migration 0013). `finished_at` is the
first sync at >= 98%, overridden by a manual status. This never estimates reading time.

### Connectors (master sync hub)

Pair external services (Hardcover, Readwise, …) to the account; reading activity fans out to them
server-side. See docs/design/sync-hub.md. All under `/api/v1`, same auth headers. Requires the
server to have `TOKEN_ENC_KEY` set (credentials are encrypted at rest) — otherwise these endpoints
report `encryption: "disabled"` and linking returns 403.

#### GET /api/v1/connectors

Lists available connectors and this account's link status.

```json
{
  "encryption": "enabled",
  "connectors": [
    {"id": "hardcover", "name": "Hardcover", "tier": 1, "beta": false,
     "carries": ["progress", "finished"], "capabilities": {"read": false, "write": true},

#### PUT /api/v1/connectors/{id}

Link/re-link by validating and storing a credential. Body: `{"credential": { ... }}` — shape is
connector-specific (`{"token": "..."}` for Hardcover and Readwise). The server validates against the
service before storing; returns `400` if rejected. `{"id": "hardcover", "linked": true,
"account": "julia"}` on success.

#### DELETE /api/v1/connectors/{id}

Unlink; wipes the stored credential, all matches, and queued work.

#### GET /api/v1/connectors/{id}/matches

Lists resolved book matches (for a review UI): `{"connector": "hardcover", "matches": [{"document",
"external_id", "confidence", "source": "auto|manual|none", "query_used", "updated_at"}]}`.
The review endpoint (`GET /connectors/{id}/review`) additionally carries `push_note`: a
per-book condition from the last successful push (e.g. Hardcover has no page count for
the book, so progress cannot sync), or null. Cleared automatically when the condition
resolves or the match changes.

#### PUT /api/v1/connectors/{id}/matches/{document}

Manually set a match (sticky — never auto-recomputed). Body `{"external_id": "42"}`, or
`{"external_id": null}` to mark "never sync this document".

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/rematch/{document}

Force (re)matching now; returns the resolved match or null. Preserves manual overrides.

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/library/refresh

Force-refresh the connector's server-side library list. `{"count": 2}`. 400 for
connectors without a refreshable library.

#### POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/lookup

Verify an externally-supplied book id against the user's account at the service.
Body `{"external_id": "…"}`. `{"found": true, "book": {"externalId", "title",
"author", "edition"}}` or `{"found": false}`. 400 for connectors without lookup.

**Matching** is server-side from the document's title/author (the EPUB metadata the firmware sends —
so connectors need "Send Metadata" on). **Fan-out** is automatic: a progress PUT enqueues a
progress/finished event to write-connectors that carry it; a clippings PUT enqueues highlight events
to highlight-connectors (Readwise). A background worker delivers them with retry/backoff.
**Fan-in** (read connectors: Audiobookshelf, BookOrbit, Readwise Reader, BookFusion) is pulled on a
background interval for library-wide providers, and on-demand — when a device asks for progress on a
matched book — for per-book providers.

### GET /healthz

Unauthenticated. `{"status": "ok", "version": "0.1.0"}`.
